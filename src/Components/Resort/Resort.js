								Ranweliâ€™s architecture blends with the unique and rich natural
								environment. The serene and idyllic location has been fully
								utilized in the layout of the land, featuring indigenous flora

								The land was originally a coconut plantation surrounded by
								wetlands mainly mangroves.In conceptualizing Ranweli, the
								architects used the spacing of the rows of the coconut trees
								(known as the coconut grid by Agriculturists) as the discipline
								for the design. The bungalows, central areas and facilities were
								built by removing the minimum number of coconut trees. For each
								bungalow constructed, only one tree was removed and the tree
								trunks were used to construct the pillars.
							</p>
							<p className="activity-body">
								{" "}
								The connecting walkways open out into beautifully tended palm
								gardens leading to the heart of the resort. Architecturally and
								aesthetically the construction and furnishing of the village
								blends western standards of comfort and with the traditions of
								indigenous Sri Lankan culture.
